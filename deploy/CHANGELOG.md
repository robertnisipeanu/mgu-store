# Deploy tool changelog

## 0.2.1

- SDK donors are stock BMW packages only; local markers and both manager lists exclude custom installs. Root splits donor bundles as an unprivileged uid/gid with a timeout and output cap, linking only returned module source strings.
- Install kits keep newer installed tools and apps while still seeding updater sources and tokens. A kit includes a token only with an explicit `--updater-token-file`.
- Snapshots exclude updater sources and credentials, which survive restores of both current and older manifests, including restores that remove the updater.
