# Deploy tool changelog

## 0.2.2

- `uninstall <id>` of an app has the running app manager uninstall it in place through the fallback copy's hook: the manager stops the app, unregisters it, which takes its tile off the HMI at once, and removes its folders, with no bounce. When the manager has no hook, does not take the request, refuses or fails it, does not finish in time or restarts, the uninstall removes the app and bounces the manager as without the hook. An app whose home's `package.json` does not name it is not handed to the manager (its home stays) and goes through the bounce.
- `install.sh` ends, while the updater (or, with `--with-uplink`, the uplink) is not running, with one line saying a head-unit restart finishes setup.

## 0.2.1

- SDK donors are stock BMW packages only; local markers and both manager lists exclude custom installs. Root splits donor bundles as an unprivileged uid/gid with a timeout and output cap, linking only returned module source strings.
- Install kits keep newer installed tools and apps while still seeding updater sources and tokens. A kit includes a token only with an explicit `--updater-token-file`.
- A package built elsewhere installs through MainApp with neither `node_modules/` nor `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (an empty shrinkwrap is added) and with a `permissions.json` lacking one of the two ACL tables (added empty). An artifact's `./` root entry is accepted.
- Snapshots exclude updater sources and credentials, which survive restores of both current and older manifests, including restores that remove the updater.
